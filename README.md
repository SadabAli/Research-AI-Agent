- `dotenv`
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SadabAli/Research-AI-Agent.git
    cd research-agentic-ai
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
      ```
      PHI_API_KEY=your_phi_api_key
      GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
      ```
    - Replace `your_phi_api_key` and `your_google_api_key` with valid API keys.

## Usage

1. Start the application:
    ```bash
    python Reaserch_AI_Agent.py
    ```

2. Access the application in your browser at:
    ```
    http://localhost:7777
